This is a automation project using VBA. The idea behind this project was to save time and increase production, bellow there is a brief explanation about the project,
i divided in 4 steps for a better understanding.

Project Files.\
EnviarEmail\
ExportarArquivo\
LimparBase\
RodarRelatorio\
1째 clear spreadsheets data - The file "LimparBase" its a simple macro that cleans the currently spreadsheets before receiving the new data.\
2째 Run report - After we have insert the new data in the spreadsheet we use the the  macro named "RodarRelatorio" to run the report and to update or main control sheet.\
3째 Export file - The macro named "ExportarArquivo" has the objective to extract information from our main control sheet (that was updated with the previous macro) and automatically update another sheet, where we can better analyze the data.\
4째 Send email - This macro sends email based on predetermined filters.

All this process used to be dona manually, in which an analyst dedicated almost 2 hours everyday to execute such task. After i implement this project the time to do the same task was reduced for something around 5 minutes.
